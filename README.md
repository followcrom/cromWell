# 🏃‍♂️ CromWell 🍋🥝🍌🍐🥥🍈

Pull Fitbit health data into InfluxDB and visualize it with Grafana. All automated via a cron job that runs once a day. It’s your personal observability pipeline! 🚀

## 🛠️ Local EDA

Just activate the venv and run jupyter lab:

```bash
source cw_venv/bin/activate
jupyter lab
```

## On the dobox

```bash
chmod 755 run_fitbit2influx.sh
chown root:root run_fitbit2influx.sh
```

## 📦 Project Overview

`fitbit2influx.py` is a Python script that:

✅ Authenticates with the Fitbit API  
📥 Pulls detailed health metrics (sleep, activity, HR, SpO₂, etc.)  
🛢 Stores that data in InfluxDB  
📈 Feeds your Grafana dashboards with up-to-date personal metrics  

`run_fitbit2influx.sh` is a shell script that:

📬 Sends an email alert if anything goes wrong

---

## 🐍 Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv cw_venv  
source cw_venv/bin/activate  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

## 🔐 Fitbit API Credentials
Make sure you've registered an app on the Fitbit developer portal and have:

- client_id
- client_secret
- A valid access token (or refresh logic)

These should be stored securely in a .env file or secure vault, loaded by the script.

## InfluxDB

```bash
influx bucket list
```

List Measurements:

```bash
influx query 'import "influxdata/influxdb/schema"
  schema.measurements(bucket: "cromwell-fitbit-2")'
```

List Tag Keys:

Tags are key-value pairs that store metadata and are indexed for fast querying. To see all the tag keys for a specific measurement:

```bash
influx query 'import "influxdata/influxdb/schema"
schema.measurementTagKeys(
bucket: "cromwell-fitbit-2",
measurement: "HRV"
)'
```

List Field Keys:

Fields are the key-value pairs that store your actual time series data (e.g., temperature, pressure). Unlike tags, fields are not indexed. To see the field keys for a measurement:

```bash
influx query 'import "influxdata/influxdb/schema"
  schema.measurementFieldKeys(
    bucket: "cromwell-fitbit-2",
    measurement: "HRV"
  )'
```

List Series:

A series is a unique combination of measurement, tag set, and field key. To see all series in a bucket:

```bash
influx query 'from(bucket: "cromwell-fitbit-2") |> range(start: -1d) |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "HeartRate_Intraday") |> sort(columns: ["_time"]) |> limit(n: 200)'
```


### Query Bounds vs. Data Timestamp 📚

When you run a query in InfluxDB, you often specify a time range using the `range(start: -7d)` function. This tells InfluxDB to return data points within the last 7 days.

The `_start` and `_stop` columns are ephemeral metadata generated by InfluxDB's query engine every time you run a query. They exist only in the query results to give you context about the time window that was searched.

The only time-related column that is permanently stored in the database alongside your values is the `_time` column.

To put it simply:

- **Stored in the Database**: _time, _measurement, _field, _value, and any tags you have (e.g., Device).

- **Generated by each Query**: _start, _stop, and other metadata columns like table.

## Issues

BST = UTC+1 - The Solution

Instead of using midnight (00:00:00), I use noon (12:00:00) in your local timezone. Why noon? Because noon BST (12:00:00+01:00) converts to 11:00:00 UTC - still on the correct date!

- Before: 2025-08-02T23:00:00+00:00 ❌ (wrong date)
- After: 2025-08-03T11:00:00+00:00 ✅ (correct date)

Many data systems do this - assign canonical timestamps to daily aggregates.

Example Timeline:

- August 3rd: You live your day, Fitbit tracks everything
- August 4th 3:00 AM: Script runs and collects yesterday's data
- August 4th 3:05 AM: Data gets written to InfluxDB with timestamp "August 3rd 11:00 AM UTC"

## Grafana Dashboard

Activites Overview:

Configure the Columns (The Magic Part ✨):
This is where you add the bar gauges. You'll use the Overrides tab on the right-hand panel. You need to create an override for each activity column.

For your "Walk" column:

Go to the Overrides tab and click "Add field override".

Select Fields with name. From the dropdown, choose Walk.

Click "+ Add override property" and select "Standard options -> Unit. From the dropdown, search for and select Time > minutes (min).

Click "+ Add override property" again and select Cell optins -> Cell type. From the dropdown, choose Gauge.

You can then customize the gauge's appearance. I have been using "Retro LCD" & "Value color".
